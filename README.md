#Starter

###Setup

`cd` to the project root and run `./setup`. Currently installs local node packages.

###Gulp

After setup run `gulp watch` to start working with gulp. You will have to install any global dependencies gulp needs that aren't included in the `setup`

###SCSS Linting

SCSS linting requires the [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) ruby gem. Run `gem install scss-lint` to install the gem.

###Browser Sync

Make sure to set `proxy: 'localhost/starter'` to target your local server.
